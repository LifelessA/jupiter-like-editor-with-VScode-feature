## 🔥 Overview

**PyQt Jupyter-Style Editor** empowers you to:

* Write, execute, and document Python code in cells (code & markdown) 🐍
* Enjoy real-time smart autocompletion with Jedi integration ⚡
* Render beautifully formatted Markdown with live previews 📝
* Visualize DataFrames and Matplotlib plots inline 📊
* Save/load sessions as JSON or native `.ipynb` notebooks 💾
* Export your entire notebook to PDF (print‑ready) 📄

**Design Canvas Tool** is embedded directly in the editor toolbar. Instantly create and insert custom graphics: flowcharts, diagrams, callouts, shapes, arrows, and more. All graphics are exported as SVG/HTML snippets into your notebook for seamless documentation.

## 📐 Architecture

### Backend (PythonBridge)

* Executes user code securely via `exec`/`eval`.
* Captures stdout, exceptions, Matplotlib figures, and Pandas DataFrames.
* Maintains a persistent `locals` dict for state across cells.
* Exposes slots: `run_code`, `get_completions`, and `open_design_tool`.

### Frontend (HTML + JavaScript)

* **CodeMirror** for code/markdown editing with custom theme.
* **Marked.js** for Markdown rendering.
* **QWebChannel** bridges JS ↔ Python.
* Dynamic cell management: add, run, stop, delete, reorder.

## 🎨 Design Canvas Details

* **Tools Panel**: Select, Crop, Text, Delete.
* **Basic Shapes**: Rectangle (rounded), Circle/Oval, Triangle, Diamond, Pentagon, Hexagon, Octagon, Star, Cross, Ring.
* **Flowchart & Misc**: Parallelogram, Trapezoid, Cylinder, Document, Cloud, Heart, Moon, Lightning Bolt.
* **Arrows & Callouts**: Arrow, Double Arrow, Speech Bubble, Thought Bubble.
* **Settings**:
